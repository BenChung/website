How do researchers know whether they are doing "enough" or "too many"
reviews? A measurable goal is to be review-neutral: to have demanded,
through our submissions, as many reviews as we have produced as
reviewers.

### Reviewing is good

I like to review academic papers. It is a very rewarding activity in
many different ways. One gets to serve the academic community, helping
it function smoothly. One gets a chance at acquiring a much better
understanding of someone else's work than idle paper-skimming
allows. One gets to send feedback to our colleagues and help them
improve their work and its presentation -- it is also an essential way
in which we can participate to the formation of student researchers
all over the world. Finally, doing reviews helped me develop the skill
the judge someone else's work and of forcing oneself to come up with
a decisive opinion -- it is surprisingly difficult and only comes with
training.

Doing reviews is also fairly time-consuming. I noticed that the time
I spend on each review is generally stable (excursions into previous
or related work excluded): around one day and a half for conference
reviews, and at least twice more for journal reviews -- I'm sure other
people have wildly different figures, but I would expect it to be
a noticeable time commitment in any case. (Workshop reviews are much
easier, at least for the formats I have seen of 2-page extended
abstracts, I'd say one hour per review.)

### How many reviews?

Because it is so time-consuming, deciding whether to say "yes" or "no"
to invitations to review a new paper is not easy: in general I want to
say "yes" (unless I can tell that I will not enjoy reading the paper
at all), but it is not reasonable to say "yes" all the time, because
I also need to spend time on other things. When should I say "no"
because I have done "too many" reviews already?

We can count the number of reviews that we have done, and we can also
estimate the number of reviews that we have demanded of others through
our submissions. A natural goal for researchers is to produce at least
as many reviews as they demand; if everyone reached this goal, the
peer-review system would be at equilibrium without imposing too much
of a workload on anyone.

To estimate the number of reviews a researcher demanded from their
peers, you can sum, for each of their submissions to a peer-reviewed
venue, the number of reviews that they received, divided by the total
number of authors of the submissions.

\\[ \sum_{p \in \mathtt{Submissions}} \frac{\mathtt{reviews}(p)}{\mathtt{authors}(p)} \\]

Out of curiosity, I just measured this balance for myself: over my
years doing research I have "demanded" 10 workshop reviews and 28.5
conference reviews, and "produced" 6 workshop reviews and 17
conference reviews. If you think that an article would interest me,
you shouldn't feel bad about asking me to review it, for now.

Of course, a researcher's balance is highly dependent on where they
are in their academic career -- maybe more so that on their personal
choices. Students are supposed to submit articles, but are offered few
opportunities for doing reviews. When they are invited to do reviews,
it is often as sub-reviewer, one review at a time. More established
researchers participate in program committees, where they have to do
a fair amount of reviews at once -- ten to twenty can be typical in
Programming Languages conferences. This means that one naturally
starts with a deficit of reviews, and that the opportunity to become
balanced or positive only comes over the years.

### Quality

This is only a comment on the quantitative aspects of reviewing. Much
more important is the qualitative part: are the reviews you receive
and produce good reviews? (There is no objective definition of what
a good review is; I like reviews that are constructive, help improve
the work and its presentation, and catch mistakes.) For a given paper,
one or a few very good reviews is more helpful than many bad reviews,
so one should not compromise on the quality of one's reviews in order
to reach a quantitative goal.
